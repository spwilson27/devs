ID: 09-AF-02
Sub-Epic: 09_Architectural Fidelity and Drift Mitigation
Related requirements: 8_RISKS-REQ-110

Description:
Define measurable fidelity metrics (e.g., schema drift score, config-conformance ratio, dependency conformance) and thresholds for alerting and blocking.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Metric definitions and formulas documented
- Thresholds and severity levels defined and ratified by architecture board
- Prototype metric collectors implemented against baseline

Tasks:
- Propose candidate metrics and collection methods
- Implement collectors for 2 key metrics
- Validate metrics against baseline data

Owner: TBD
Estimate: 2d
