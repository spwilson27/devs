# Phase 1: Foundation & Project Vision

## Objective
Establish the foundational vision, goals, and research-backed strategy for the devs project. This phase focuses on defining the "What" and "Why" through comprehensive market, user, and competitive research, and setting the success metrics and architectural pillars that will guide all subsequent development.

## Requirements Covered
- [[GOALS]]: Project goals for TTM compression, boilerplate elimination, and reliability.
- [[PILLARS]]: Architectural pillars (Research-First, ADD, TDD, Glass-Box, MCP-Native).
- [[REQ-RES-PLAN]]: Research management and project planning requirements.
- [[REQ-MR-CORE]]: Market Research core requirements (MCP, VSCode, zero-data-retention).
- [[REQ-UR-CORE]]: User Research core requirements (Glass-Box, empirical verification).
- [[REQ-NEED-CORE]]: Persona-specific needs for all devs stakeholders.
- [[REQ-COMP-CORE]]: Competitive Analysis for architecture and TDD prioritization.
- [[REQ-MET-CORE]]: Project success metrics (TAR, TTFC, RTI, etc.).
- [[REQ-PIL-001] - [REQ-PIL-005]]: Implementation of architectural pillars.
- [[REQ-GOAL-001] - [REQ-GOAL-008]]: Specific functional and strategic project goals.
- [[REQ-OOS-CORE]]: Definition of out-of-scope boundaries to prevent scope creep.

## Detailed Deliverables & Components
### Research & Strategy Reports
- Finalized Market Research, User Research, and Competitive Analysis reports.
- Comprehensive Persona Needs map.
- Architectural Pillars documentation.

### Project Governance & Planning
- Defined Project Goals and Success Metrics (KPIs).
- Initial project plan and research management framework.
- Out-of-Scope (OOS) boundaries document.

## Technical Considerations
- Ensuring research reports are "Agent-Ready" (authoritative, unambiguous, Mermaid-based diagrams).
- Establishing the baseline for "Glass-Box" architecture requirements during the research phase.
