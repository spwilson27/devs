# @devs/mcp — Agent Documentation

## Package Purpose

Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server interface for `devs`. Exposes
`@devs/core` capabilities as MCP tools and resources so that external AI agents
(Claude, Cursor, etc.) can interact with and introspect the `devs` pipeline.

## Responsibilities

- MCP server initialization and transport (stdio / HTTP-SSE)
- Tool definitions: pipeline control, task status, memory queries
- Resource definitions: project documents, task files, agent memory
- Agentic debugging and profiling endpoints

## Key Constraints

- Thin adapter layer — no business logic. All logic delegates to `@devs/core`.
- Must expose a stable, versioned MCP schema.
- All tool inputs/outputs must be validated (Zod schemas recommended).

## Consumers

| Package         | Usage                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| External agents | Connect via MCP to interact with devs pipeline|
| `@devs/cli`     | May embed MCP client for local tool use       |

## AOD Convention

Every production module in `packages/mcp/src/` must have a corresponding
`.agent.md` at the same relative path in this directory.
