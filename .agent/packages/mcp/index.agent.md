# index.ts — @devs/mcp Entry Point

## Purpose

Package entry point for `@devs/mcp`. Currently a stub that re-exports nothing.
MCP server capabilities for agent debugging and profiling will be exported here.

## Exports

None yet (infrastructure phase).

## Notes

- This stub satisfies the TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` build step.
- Future phases will add exports for the MCP server interface exposing core capabilities.
