# git/ — Git Integration & Snapshot Strategy

## Purpose

This directory contains the git client wrapper used by the devs pipeline to
snapshot intermediate project state during agentic code generation. All git
interactions are funnelled through a typed, mockable abstraction over
`simple-git` to keep the rest of the codebase decoupled from git internals.

## Modules

| Module        | Description                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `GitClient`   | Typed wrapper over `simple-git`: init, status, add, commit |

## Design Constraints

- `simple-git` is the only permitted git library. Direct use of `child_process`
  git calls is forbidden in this package.
- All file paths MUST be normalized via `upath` before being passed to git
  operations (cross-platform correctness).
- All public methods MUST throw `GitError` on failure — never raw `Error`.
- No host git config (user.name/email) is assumed; defaults are injected
  locally if missing.
