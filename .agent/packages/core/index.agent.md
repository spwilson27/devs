# index.ts — @devs/core Entry Point

## Purpose

Package entry point for `@devs/core`. Currently a stub that re-exports nothing.
All public surface area will be exported from this module as the package matures.

## Exports

None yet (infrastructure phase).

## Notes

- This stub satisfies the TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` build step.
- Future phases will add exports for pipeline orchestration and agent lifecycle APIs.
