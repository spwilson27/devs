# @devs/core — Agent Documentation

## Package Purpose

Core business logic for the `devs` AI orchestration system. All domain logic,
pipeline orchestration, and agent lifecycle management lives here. This package
is intentionally headless — it has no UI, CLI, or network layer.

## Responsibilities

- AI pipeline orchestration (research → specs → requirements → tasks → TDD loop)
- Agent lifecycle management and task dispatch
- Project state coordination
- Integration with `@devs/memory` for persistence

## Key Constraints

- **MUST NOT** depend on `@devs/sandbox` (hard constraint, enforced by
  `tests/infrastructure/verify_monorepo.sh`, per TAS-096).
- No UI code — headless-first design.
- All public interfaces must be stable for consumers: `@devs/agents`,
  `@devs/mcp`, `@devs/cli`, `@devs/vscode`.

## Consumers

| Package         | Usage                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `@devs/agents`  | Invokes core pipeline orchestration    |
| `@devs/mcp`     | Exposes core capabilities via MCP      |
| `@devs/cli`     | Thin CLI shell delegating to core      |
| `@devs/vscode`  | VSCode extension shell delegating here |

## AOD Convention

Every production module added to `packages/core/src/` **must** have a
corresponding `.agent.md` file at the same relative path in this directory.

Example:
```
packages/core/src/pipeline.ts → .agent/packages/core/pipeline.agent.md
packages/core/src/agents/runner.ts → .agent/packages/core/agents/runner.agent.md
```
