# @devs/vscode — Agent Documentation

## Package Purpose

Implements the VSCode Extension for `devs`. A thin UI shell that surfaces the
`devs` pipeline within the VSCode editor. Provides panels, webviews, and status
bar items for monitoring and controlling the generation pipeline.

## Responsibilities

- VSCode extension activation and deactivation lifecycle
- Command palette integration (devs.init, devs.run, devs.status, etc.)
- Webview panels for pipeline visualization and approval workflows
- Status bar progress indicators
- Delegation of all logic to `@devs/core`

## Key Constraints

- UI shell only — no business logic may live in this package.
- Must use the VSCode API exclusively for UI; all domain operations delegate
  to `@devs/core`.
- Bundle size matters — avoid heavy dependencies; use tree-shaking where possible.
- Depends on `@devs/core`; must NOT depend on `@devs/sandbox` directly.

## Consumers

| Package   | Usage                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| VSCode    | Loads as an extension via extension host |

## AOD Convention

Every production module in `packages/vscode/src/` must have a corresponding
`.agent.md` at the same relative path in this directory.
