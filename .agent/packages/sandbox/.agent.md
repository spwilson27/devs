# @devs/sandbox — Agent Documentation

## Package Purpose

Provides an isolated execution environment for AI-generated code. The sandbox
prevents generated code from accessing host system resources or performing
unscoped operations outside the currently assigned task.

## Responsibilities

- Sandboxed code execution (e.g., via Docker or a process jail)
- Resource limiting (CPU, memory, network, disk)
- Scope enforcement — prevents agents from working ahead of their assigned task
- Output capture and streaming to `@devs/core`

## Key Constraints

- **Strictly isolated:** `@devs/core` must NEVER depend on `@devs/sandbox`.
  This boundary is enforced by `tests/infrastructure/verify_monorepo.sh`.
- `@devs/sandbox` may depend on `@devs/core` for shared types, but core
  orchestration must not create a circular dependency.
- All sandbox interfaces must be defensive — assume untrusted input.

## Consumers

| Package         | Usage                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `@devs/core`    | FORBIDDEN — core must not depend on sandbox|
| `@devs/agents`  | May invoke sandbox for code execution      |

## AOD Convention

Every production module in `packages/sandbox/src/` must have a corresponding
`.agent.md` at the same relative path in this directory.
