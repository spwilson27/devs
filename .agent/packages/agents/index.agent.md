# index.ts — @devs/agents Entry Point

## Purpose

Package entry point for `@devs/agents`. Currently a stub that re-exports nothing.
Concrete agent implementations will be exported from here in later phases.

## Exports

None yet (infrastructure phase).

## Notes

- This stub satisfies the TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` build step.
- Future phases will add exports for individual pipeline stage agents.
