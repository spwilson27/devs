# @devs/agents — Agent Documentation

## Package Purpose

Houses the concrete AI agent implementations used by the `devs` orchestration
pipeline. Each agent is a focused, stateless unit that performs a specific step
in the pipeline (e.g., ResearchAgent, SpecAgent, TaskAgent, TDDAgent).

## Responsibilities

- Implement individual pipeline stage agents
- Prompt construction and LLM API interaction
- Agent output parsing and validation
- Loop detection and token budget management

## Key Constraints

- Agents must be stateless — all state is managed by `@devs/core`.
- Depends on `@devs/core` for orchestration primitives and shared types.
- Must NOT depend on `@devs/sandbox` directly.

## Consumers

| Package     | Usage                                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `@devs/core`| Invokes agents as part of the pipeline  |

## AOD Convention

Every production module in `packages/agents/src/` must have a corresponding
`.agent.md` at the same relative path in this directory.
