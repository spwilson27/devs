# index.ts — @devs/memory Entry Point

## Purpose

Package entry point for `@devs/memory`. Currently a stub that re-exports nothing.
Persistent memory store APIs (SQLite + LanceDB) will be exported here in later phases.

## Exports

None yet (infrastructure phase).

## Notes

- This stub satisfies the TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` build step.
- Future phases will add exports for agent memory persistence via SQLite and LanceDB.
