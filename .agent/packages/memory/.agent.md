# @devs/memory — Agent Documentation

## Package Purpose

Manages all forms of agent memory: short-term (current task context),
medium-term (phase/epic architectural decisions), and long-term (project-wide
constraints). Backed by SQLite (structured data) and LanceDB (vector search).

## Responsibilities

- Short-term context storage for in-flight tasks
- Medium-term phase decision logging
- Long-term project constraint persistence (e.g., "Always use FP patterns")
- Semantic similarity search via vector embeddings (LanceDB)
- Exclusive write access to `.devs/` runtime state (Flight Recorder)

## Key Constraints

- Only `@devs/core` and `@devs/memory` may write to `.devs/` runtime files.
  Developer Agents have NO write access (see `.devs/POLICY.md`).
- Memory operations must be idempotent — duplicate writes must be safe.
- All reads/writes must be transactional to avoid corruption.

## Storage Backends

| Backend      | Purpose                          | Runtime path        |
|--------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| SQLite       | Structured task/decision logs    | `.devs/state.db`    |
| LanceDB      | Vector embeddings for search     | `.devs/vectors/`    |

## Consumers

| Package      | Usage                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `@devs/core` | Reads/writes all memory tiers               |
| `@devs/agents`| Reads context memory for task execution    |

## AOD Convention

Every production module in `packages/memory/src/` must have a corresponding
`.agent.md` at the same relative path in this directory.
