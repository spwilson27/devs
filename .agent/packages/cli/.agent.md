# @devs/cli — Agent Documentation

## Package Purpose

Provides the command-line interface (CLI) for `devs`. A thin UI shell that
delegates all business logic to `@devs/core`. Users interact with the `devs`
pipeline via subcommands (e.g., `devs init`, `devs run`, `devs status`).

## Responsibilities

- CLI argument parsing and validation
- User-facing progress output and error formatting
- Process lifecycle management (start, stop, monitor)
- Delegation of all operations to `@devs/core`

## Key Constraints

- UI shell only — no business logic may live in this package.
- Must remain a thin adapter: every command handler should be 1–2 function calls
  into `@devs/core`.
- Depends on `@devs/core`; must NOT depend on `@devs/sandbox` directly.

## Consumers

| Package      | Usage                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| End users    | Direct CLI invocation              |
| `@devs/vscode`| May shell out to CLI for some ops |

## AOD Convention

Every production module in `packages/cli/src/` must have a corresponding
`.agent.md` at the same relative path in this directory.
