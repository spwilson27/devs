# Agent Long-Term Memory

This file serves as a shared, long-term memory for all agents working on this project. Agents should append to this document to record important architectural decisions, recurring issues, project-wide conventions, and any other crucial context that future tasks will benefit from.

## 🏛️ Architectural Decisions
*Note overarching design choices, patterns, or project-wide conventions here.*

- **2026-02-20 - Initial Setup:** Started long-term memory to ensure agents pass architectural messages to one another. Agents should actively review and append to this doc when making meaningful structural changes.

## ⚠️ Brittle Areas (Proceed with Caution)
*Note parts of the codebase that are prone to breaking, have complex undocumented dependencies, or should generally not be refactored without extreme care.*

- *(No brittle areas identified yet.)*

## 📝 Recent Changelog
*Append brief summaries of recent agent or user tasks here to keep everyone in sync.*

- **[2026-02-20] - Task Name / ID:** Brief description of changes made. (Template)
