Module purpose: mandatory middleware filter that redacts secrets from all sandbox I/O streams before they are stored or returned to the LLM.

Exported public API:
- ISecretMasker
- IRedactionResult
- IRedactionHit
- SecretMasker
- SecretMaskerFactory
- EntropyScanner
- IEntropyHit

Agentic Hooks:
- Entry point: SecretMaskerFactory.create()
- Use maskStream() for streaming pipelines or mask() for discrete string redaction.

Entropy Engine:
- Implements Shannon entropy calculation over Unicode code points to detect high-randomness tokens.
- Default threshold: 4.5 bits. Default min token length: 16 characters.
- Runs after regex-based redaction to avoid re-processing already-replaced "[REDACTED]" placeholders.
- Threshold and minLength are configurable via EntropyScanner constructor.

Extension points:
- Future tasks will inject regex patterns and additional redaction phases via constructor injection.
