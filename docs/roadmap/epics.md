# Roadmap Epics (P3-P8)

This document provides concise summaries for the default roadmap epics seeded by the ProjectManager.DEFAULT_ROADMAP (P1-P8). It focuses on Phases 3 through 8 which are considered future phases in a fresh project.

- P3 - Discovery
  - Goal: Explore problem space, perform user research, generate requirements, and validate feasibility.
  - Deliverables: Research report, user journeys, prioritized requirement list.

- P4 - Synthesis
  - Goal: Consolidate research into architecture and specifications (PRD, TAS, MCP design).
  - Deliverables: PRD draft, high-level architecture diagrams, risk register.

- P5 - Planning
  - Goal: Break phases into epics and atomic tasks, estimate cost and schedule, define milestones.
  - Deliverables: Roadmap, milestones, initial task DAG for phase work.

- P6 - Implementation
  - Goal: Develop core systems and services defined by earlier phases using TDD and CI.
  - Deliverables: Working services, integration tests, deployment scripts.

- P7 - Interface
  - Goal: Build the user-facing shells (CLI, VSCode) and UX flows that interact with the core.
  - Deliverables: CLI commands, VSCode extension scaffolding, user acceptance tests.

- P8 - Optimization
  - Goal: Performance tuning, cost optimization, security hardening, and final polish.
  - Deliverables: Performance reports, security audit fixes, optimized pipelines.
