# Project Roadmap: Project 'devs'

## 1. Roadmap Overview & Phasing Strategy

The 'devs' project roadmap is engineered to transition from a theoretical multi-agent concept to a production-grade, autonomous software engineering system through a **Dependency-Aware Phasing Strategy**. The roadmap rejects a feature-first approach in favor of a **Foundation-First Infrastructure**, prioritizing the system's "Cerebral Cortex" (Orchestrator) and "Motor Cortex" (Sandbox) before implementing higher-order "Intelligence" (Research and Implementation Agents).

This strategy is built on the **Glass-Box Mandate**: every phase must produce queryable state and audit logs. There is no "black box" development; the system's ability to observe itself is a prerequisite for its ability to build other systems.

### 1.1 The "Foundation-First" Philosophy
The roadmap is divided into three major milestones, each representing a leap in the system's level of autonomy and reliability:
1.  **Milestone 1: The Deterministic Engine (Phases 1-2)**: Establishing the ACID-compliant state machine and the secure execution environment. The goal is a system that can fail safely and resume perfectly.
2.  **Milestone 3: The Architect's Intelligence (Phases 3-5)**: Deploying the "Discovery" and "Design" agents. The goal is to move from ambiguous user prompts to mathematically traceable Requirement DAGs.
3.  **Milestone 3: The Autonomous Loop (Phases 6-8)**: Activating the TDD implementation engine and multi-modal interfaces. The goal is the delivery of verified, agent-ready codebases.

### 1.2 Phasing Strategy & Dependency Logic
The order of operations is governed by the following critical dependencies:
- **Persistence before Planning**: The SQLite state manager and checkpointer (Phase 1) must be robust enough to handle the massive context generated by the Research Agents (Phase 3).
- **Isolation before Implementation**: The Docker/WebContainer sandbox and the SecretMasker (Phase 2) must be fully operational before the Developer Agent (Phase 6) is allowed to execute a single shell command.
- **Distillation before Execution**: The Requirement Distiller (Phase 5) is the "Compiler" of the roadmap; it transforms high-level Markdown (Phase 4) into the Task DAG that drives the implementation loop.

### 1.3 Phasing Summary

| Phase | Designation | Primary Objective | Technical Key Results (KRs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1** | **Foundation** | The "Brain" | LangGraph.js State Machine; SQLite ACID persistence; Tiered Memory (S/M/L); SAOP Schema definition. |
| **P2** | **Execution** | The "Hands" | Hardened Docker/WebContainer Sandbox; MCP SDK integration; Real-time SecretMasker; Surgical Edit tools. |
| **P3** | **Discovery** | The "Eyes" | Parallel Research Manager; Serper/Search integration; Markdown Content Extraction; Source Credibility Scoring. |
| **P4** | **Synthesis** | The "Blueprint" | Architect Agent (PRD/TAS); Mermaid.js Auto-Generation; Security/UX Spec Agents; HITL Approval Gates. |
| **P5** | **Planning** | The "Strategy" | Requirement Distiller (REQ-ID Mapping); Epic & Task DAG Generator; Token/Cost Estimation Heuristics. |
| **P6** | **Implementation** | The "Loop" | TDD Orchestrator (Red-Green-Refactor); Developer Agent; Independent Reviewer; Entropy/Loop Detector. |
| **P7** | **Interface** | The "Lens" | CLI (Ink TUI); VSCode Extension (React); SAOP Real-time Trace Streaming; Interactive DAG UI. |
| **P8** | **Optimization** | The "Polish" | Global Validation (Phase 5 of devs); Project MCP Templates; Self-Hosting; Agent-Ready Templates. |

### 1.4 Gated Autonomy & Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
The roadmap incorporates five "Hard Gates" where the orchestrator suspends execution until a human user issues a `RESUME` directive via the CLI or VSCode:
1.  **The Research Gate (Post-Phase 3)**: Approval of the Research Suite (Market, Tech, Comp, User). [9_ROADMAP-REQ-001]
2.  **The Blueprint Gate (Post-Phase 4)**: Approval of the PRD and TAS. This freezes the architectural DNA. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-002]
3.  **The Roadmap Gate (Post-Phase 5)**: Approval of the 8-16 Epics and 200+ Tasks. This authorizes the implementation spend. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-003]
4.  **The Epic Start Gate**: User review of the upcoming tasks at the beginning of each Epic. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-004]
5.  **The Final Validation Gate (Post-Phase 8)**: The "Zero-Defect" audit before the project is marked as `COMPLETED`. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-005]

Additionally, the **Task Failure Gate (HITL Recovery)** is triggered if an agent hits the entropy limit. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-006]

### 1.5 Technical Unknowns & Execution Risks
- **Context Management**: Can the `ContextPruner` (Phase 1) effectively manage the 1M+ token context of Gemini 3 Pro during 50+ turn implementation tasks without losing architectural focus?
- **Sandbox Parity**: Will `WebContainers` (Phase 2) provide enough syscall coverage for complex backend projects (e.g., PostgreSQL/Redis mock-ups) within the VSCode Web environment?
- **Agentic Entropy**: Will the `EntropyDetector` (Phase 6) be sensitive enough to detect subtle "logical loops" where an agent is not repeating an error but is failing to make progress on a requirement?

## 2. Logical Flow Diagram

The 'devs' operational lifecycle is a deterministic state machine managed by LangGraph.js, transitioning from ambiguous intent to verified code. The flow is partitioned into three distinct segments: **Discovery**, **Planning**, and the **TDD Execution Loop**.

### 2.1 Stage Transitions & State Logic

1.  **Discovery-to-Architecture (P3 -> P4)**: The transition occurs once the Research Manager Agent confirms that confidence scores for Market, Tech, and Competitive reports exceed 85%. If scores are low, the system triggers a "Deep Search" recursive turn. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-007]
2.  **The Blueprint Gate (Gate 1)**: This is a blocking synchronous wait. The orchestrator persists the current LangGraph checkpoint to SQLite and enters a `WAITING_FOR_USER` state. Implementation cannot begin until a signed `approval_token` is written to the `documents` table. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-008]
3.  **The Distillation Compiler (P5)**: Phase 5 acts as a "Compiler" for the project. It validates that 100% of the `Must-have` requirements in the PRD are mapped to at least one task in the DAG. Any "Orphaned Requirements" trigger an automated re-distillation turn. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-009]
4.  **The TDD implementation Loop (P6)**:
    *   **Context Injection**: Every turn in the loop is preceded by a `ContextRefresh` where the `ContextPruner` ensures the 1M token window contains the PRD, TAS, and the active task requirements. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-010]
    *   **The Red-Phase Gate**: A task MUST fail its test in the sandbox before implementation begins. This prevents "hallucination-driven success" where an agent claims a task is done without verifying it. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-011]
    *   **Entropy Detection**: The system hashes the last 3 terminal outputs. If hashes match, the `EntropyDetector` interrupts the loop and invokes a `PivotAgent` to rethink the implementation strategy from first principles. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-012]
5.  **Multi-Agent Verification (ReviewNode)**: Verification is performed by a separate agent instance with a "Hostile Auditor" prompt. It validates: [9_ROADMAP-REQ-013]
    *   **Functional Integrity**: All tests in the Epic pass.
    *   **Architectural Fidelity**: No unapproved libraries or pattern violations (checked against TAS).
    *   **Documentation Density**: Presence of `.agent.md` files for new modules.

### 2.2 Persistence & Recovery Protocol

*   **ACID State Transitions**: Every node transition in the diagram (e.g., `Green` to `Sandbox2`) is recorded as a LangGraph checkpoint in SQLite. If the process is killed mid-turn, the system resumes from the exact same "Thought" or "Action" turn. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-014]
*   **Git-SQLite Correlation**: Every `CommitNode` execution updates the `tasks` table with the `git_commit_hash`. This allows the "Time-Travel" feature (`devs rewind`) to perfectly synchronize the filesystem and the database. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-015]

### 2.3 Critical Path & Edge Cases

| Flow Edge Case | Orchestrator Response | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ambiguous Brief** | Research Agent triggers `AIC` (Agent-Initiated Clarification). | [9_ROADMAP-REQ-UI-013] |
| **TAS Violation** | Reviewer Agent blocks commit and returns task to `PlanNode`. | [9_ROADMAP-REQ-IMP-002] |
| **Sandbox Breach** | `SandboxMonitor` kills process and triggers `SECURITY_PAUSE`. | [9_ROADMAP-REQ-SEC-004] |
| **Context Exhaustion** | `ContextPruner` executes Flash-model summarization turn. | [9_ROADMAP-REQ-SYS-001] |
| **Dependency Deadlock**| Distiller Agent flags circular dependency and requests user DAG edit. | [9_ROADMAP-REQ-PLAN-003] |

## 4. Critical Path Analysis

The critical path for 'devs' is defined by the **Cascading Fidelity Sequence**. Because 'devs' is a "Glass-Box" system where requirements are traced from research to implementation, any latency in the earlier "Discovery" or "Design" phases creates non-linear delays in the implementation loop.

### 4.1 The Core Backbone: SAOP and Persistence (P1)
The **Structured Agent-Orchestrator Protocol (SAOP)** is the project's most significant "Long Pole" dependency.
- **Criticality**: Every agent node (Research, Architect, Developer, Reviewer) depends on the deterministic parsing of the SAOP envelope. A failure in SAOP stability during Phase 1 will invalidate all subsequent agent logic.
- **Blocker**: The `SQLiteSaver` checkpointer must achieve 100% ACID compliance before P3 (Research) can begin, as the research context often exceeds 500k tokens per session.
- **Requirement**: Implement a "Protocol Freeze" milestone at the end of P1 to prevent breaking changes during the implementation of P6. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-043]

### 4.2 The "Hands" Bottleneck: Sandbox and Security (P2)
The **Isolated Execution Environment** is the prerequisite for the TDD Loop (P6).
- **Hard Dependency**: The `SecretMasker` and `NetworkEgressProxy` must be 100% reliable before the Developer Agent is granted `shell_exec` capabilities.
- **Edge Case**: If the sandbox fails to provide a 1:1 parity between Docker (CLI) and WebContainers (VSCode), the project roadmap for the VSCode Extension will diverge significantly.
- **Risk**: Sandbox provisioning latency must be < 30s to maintain implementation velocity. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-044]

### 4.3 The Logical Compiler: Requirement Distillation (P5)
Phase 5 is the **Logical Bridge** between human-approved blueprints and machine-executable tasks.
- **Criticality**: This is the highest reasoning-risk phase. If the Distiller cannot consistently break complex PRD requirements into atomic tasks (< 200 LoC delta), the Developer Agent in P6 will enter a state of "Reasoning Collapse" or high entropy.
- **Task Granularity**: The Distiller must enforce a "Task Complexity Cap." Any task estimated to require > 10 implementation turns must be recursively decomposed. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-045]
- **Verification**: 100% mapping of PRD `Must-have` requirements to the Task DAG is the "Go/No-Go" gate for the implementation phase.

### 4.4 Implementation Parallelization and Buffer Management
- **Concurrent Tracks**: Once the SAOP and State Machine (P1) are frozen, P3 (Research) and P7 (Interface/VSCode Extension) can proceed in parallel.
- **P6 Resource Drain**: The TDD loop (P6) is estimated to consume 75% of the total project token budget and 60% of the development timeline.
- **Entropy Buffer**: A 20% "Research & Strategy" buffer is allocated within P6 to account for the `StrategyPivotAgent` and human-in-the-loop recovery cycles. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-046]

### 4.5 Unknowns & Critical Blocker Questions
- **[9_ROADMAP-BLOCKER-001]**: Will the `ContextPruner` be able to maintain architectural intent across 100+ turns without triggering "Model Drift"?
- **[9_ROADMAP-BLOCKER-002]**: Is the `surgical_edit` tool precise enough to handle multi-file refactors without introducing syntax errors that the agent cannot recover from?
- **[9_ROADMAP-BLOCKER-003]**: How does the system handle "Dependency Deadlocks" where two parallel tasks in the same Epic require conflicting library versions?

## 5. Phase Transition Checkpoints (Definition of Done)

To ensure the "Glass-Box" integrity and prevent cascading failures, each phase must satisfy a rigorous set of entry and exit criteria. No phase transition is permitted until 100% of its "Definition of Done" (DoD) requirements are met and persisted in the `state.sqlite` audit log.

### 5.1 [9_ROADMAP-DOD-P1] Foundation (The Brain)
*   **State Integrity**: `SQLiteSaver` must pass "Chaos Testing" (simulated process kills during high-frequency writes) with 0% state corruption. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-016]
*   **Schema Validation**: All 7 core tables (projects, documents, requirements, epics, tasks, agent_logs, entropy_events) must support ACID transactions. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-017]
*   **SAOP Compliance**: The `Structured Agent-Orchestrator Protocol` must validate 100% of agent envelopes against the versioned JSON schema. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-018]
*   **Memory Efficiency**: `ContextPruner` must successfully compress a 1M token context into a <200k token summary without losing P3 (Must-have) requirements. [9_ROADMAP-REQ-019]
