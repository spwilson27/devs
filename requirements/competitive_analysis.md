- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-003]** Glass-Box Transparency
- **Type:** UX
- **Description:** The system must provide high levels of visibility into the agent's step-by-step reasoning and allow for human intervention at any point in the process.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-004]** Standardized Architectural Documentation
- **Type:** Functional
- **Description:** The system must generate a formal set of architectural documents (PRD, TAS, MCP Arch) to guide the development process.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-005]** Native MCP Integration
- **Type:** Technical
- **Description:** The system must natively support Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agentic debugging and profiling of the project being developed.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-006]** Agent-Ready Project Output
- **Type:** Technical
- **Description:** All software generated by the system must be "Agent-Ready," meaning it includes built-in MCP servers and clear structures to facilitate future agentic maintenance, debugging, and profiling.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-007]** Loop Prevention & Token Efficiency
- **Type:** Non-Functional
- **Description:** The system must implement explicit user intervention points and requirement distillation techniques to prevent agents from entering expensive, repetitive loops.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-008]** Multi-Modal Interface Support
- **Type:** UX
- **Description:** The system must be accessible via multiple interfaces, specifically a VSCode Extension, a CLI tool, and an MCP interface.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-009]** Tiered Agent Memory Management
- **Type:** Technical
- **Description:** The system must maintain three levels of memory for agents: Short-term (current task context), Medium-term (phase/epic architectural decisions), and Long-term (project-wide constraints).
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-010]** Structured Project Decomposition
- **Type:** Functional
- **Description:** The system must break projects into a series of high-level ordered phases (8-16 Epics) and further decompose those into atomic tasks (25+ per phase) to reduce cognitive load per agent call.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-011]** Automated Task Verification & Documentation
- **Type:** Technical
- **Description:** Every task completion must include an automated code review, automated testing validation, and updates to both project documentation and agent memory.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-012]** Sandboxed Agent Execution
- **Type:** Security
- **Description:** All agent-led code execution and development tasks must be performed within a sandboxed environment to mitigate security risks.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None

### **[COMP-013]** Per-Project Security Design
- **Type:** Security
- **Description:** The system must generate a specific "Security Design" document for every project it builds to identify and mitigate risks.
- **Source:** Competitive Analysis Report (research/competitive_analysis.md)
- **Dependencies:** None
