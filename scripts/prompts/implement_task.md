# Instructions

You are operating inside of a git worktree checked out specifically for you.

1.  **Analyze the Task:** Carefully read the requirements, context, and any previous code in your workspace.
2.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** 
    - First, write tests for the feature you are about to implement. 
    - Ensure your tests capture edge cases and core requirements.
    - Run `./do test` to verify your tests are running and appropriately failing.
3.  **Implement Feature:**
    - Write the actual feature code.
    - Use best practices, clear naming, and robust error handling.
4.  **Verify (Presubmit):**
    - Run `./do presubmit`. 
    - If it fails, fix the issues until it passes cleanly.
5.  **Document:**
    - Update `/.agent/memory.md` with:
      - Any new **Architectural Decisions** you made (patterns, conventions).
      - Any **Brittle Areas** you discovered.
      - A brief description of what you broke/fixed/added to the **Recent Changelog**.

# CONSTRAINTS
- ALWAYS end your turn when your implementation is complete and `./do presubmit` passes.
- Do NOT commit your code. The orchestrator will handle the git commits.
- You must write your output using your file editing tools directly. DO NOT output the code into this chat prompt.
