# User Research Report: devs

## 1. Executive Summary
The software development landscape is shifting from manual coding to agentic orchestration. **devs** aims to solve the "Blank Page Problem" and the "Technical Debt Trap" by providing a structured, agent-driven pipeline for greenfield development. 

Our research identifies a primary target audience of **experienced developers venturing into new domains**, **indie hackers seeking rapid but robust MVPs**, and **technical architects who demand transparency (Glass-Box)** over autonomous "black-box" systems. The key to success for `devs` lies in its ability to maintain high-fidelity architectural control through human-approvable documents (PRD/TAS) and a verifiable TDD cycle.

## 2. Target Audience Segments

### Segment A: The Polyglot Maker
Developers who are technically proficient in one stack (e.g., Backend/Java) but want to build a project in another (e.g., Frontend/React + FastAPI). They need the AI to act as an "Architect-in-Residence" that ensures idiomatic patterns.

### Segment B: The High-Stakes Indie Hacker
Solo founders or small teams building products where reliability is a core feature. They cannot afford "chat-to-code" hallucinations and require a system that enforces testing and documentation from day one.

### Segment C: The Enterprise Prototyper
Internal tool builders or R&D engineers who need to quickly spin up prototypes that adhere to corporate security and architectural standards without the manual overhead of boilerplate setup.

## 3. User Personas

### Persona 1: Alex, the Polyglot Prototype Builder
*   **Role:** Senior Full-Stack Engineer
*   **Demographics:** 32 years old, works in a mid-sized tech firm.
*   **Tech-Savviness:** Expert. Familiar with CI/CD, Git, and complex architectures.
*   **Goals:** 
    *   Build a side project using a language they aren't an expert in (e.g., Rust).
    *   Ensure the project doesn't become a "mess of spaghetti code" generated by LLMs.
*   **Frustrations:** 
    *   Standard AI assistants often suggest deprecated libraries or non-idiomatic code.
    *   The time spent fixing AI bugs often exceeds the time saved.
*   **Needs:** A system that presents a Technical Architecture Specification (TAS) for approval *before* a single line of code is written.

### Persona 2: Sarah, the Quality-Obsessed Founder
*   **Role:** Technical Founder of a Fintech Startup
*   **Demographics:** 29 years old, based in Berlin.
*   **Tech-Savviness:** High. Strong background in Security and TDD.
*   **Goals:** 
    *   Launch an MVP in 2 weeks with 90%+ test coverage.
    *   Have a "Glass-Box" view of every decision the AI makes for audit purposes.
*   **Frustrations:** 
    *   "Black-box" agents like Devin feel too risky for financial logic.
    *   Wasting money on AI agents that get stuck in infinite loops.
*   **Needs:** Branching/Time-travel capabilities to undo an AI's "bad turn" and re-direct development without restarting the project.

### Persona 3: Marcus, the Enterprise Developer
*   **Role:** Lead Developer (Operations)
*   **Demographics:** 40 years old, Enterprise environment.
*   **Tech-Savviness:** Mid-to-High. Focuses on stability and documentation.
*   **Goals:** 
    *   Automate the creation of internal dashboards and CLI tools.
    *   Ensure every project includes agentic debugging support so it's easy to maintain.
*   **Frustrations:** 
    *   Agents working "ahead of schedule" or modifying files outside of their current task scope.
    *   Lack of long-term memory in AI chat interfaces.
*   **Needs:** Sandboxed execution and persistent "Long-term Memory" that remembers enterprise-wide constraints (e.g., "Never use external CSS").

## 4. User Pain Points & Needs

| Pain Point | User Need | `devs` Feature Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architectural Drift** | High-level planning before implementation. | PRD/TAS Research & Approval Phase |
| **Black-Box Anxiety** | Visibility into AI reasoning and decisions. | Glass-Box Architecture / Markdown Docs |
| **Token Runaway** | Preventing agents from wasting time/money. | Loop Detection & Budget Gates |
| **Context Loss** | Persistent memory across long-running tasks. | Vector-based Long-term Memory (ChromaDB) |
| **Unreliable Code** | Verifiable correctness of AI outputs. | Mandatory TDD Cycle (Test -> Implement -> Review) |
| **Stochastic Dead-ends** | Ability to "undo" and try a different path. | Time-Travel & Branching (Git for Prompts) |

## 5. Core User Journeys

### Journey 1: From Idea to Architectural Approval
This journey covers the initial research and documentation phase where the user establishes the project's foundation.

    participant ORC as Orchestrator
    participant RA as Research Agent
    participant AA as Architect Agent

    User->>ORC: Provide Description & Journeys
    ORC->>RA: Research Problem Space
    RA->>ORC: Market/Competitive/Tech Reports
    ORC->>AA: Generate PRD & TAS
    AA->>User: Present Documents for Approval
    Note over User, AA: User reviews/edits architectural decisions
    User->>ORC: Approve Documents
    ORC->>ORC: Distill Requirements & Epics
```

### Journey 2: Branching and Time-Travel Intervention
This journey illustrates how a user corrects an agent's path using the "Git for Prompts" feature.

```mermaid

    A[Start Development] --> B[Task 1: Complete]
    B --> C[Task 2: In Progress]
    C --> D{User Monitors Dashboard}
    D -- "AI makes bad choice" --> E[Pause Process]
    E --> F[Time-Travel to Post-Task 1 State]
    F --> G[Provide New Feedback/Requirement]
    G --> H[Create New 'Branch']
    H --> I[Resume Development on New Path]
```

### Journey 3: The Automated TDD Cycle
This journey shows the granular implementation of a single task within a project phase.
